## Step 0 - Creating a React app

The first step in this React Router tutorial is creating a new React app. In case you already have a project, you can skip this step.


```bash
npx create-react-app router-tutorial
```

Go the directory you just creating and run the application. Check that a React app is now running on http://localhost:3000.

```bash
cd router-tutorial # go to the root of the project
npm start # starts the app
```
