# React Router - Tutorial
In this repository you will find all the code related to the React Router tutorial. For each step there is a branch available with code related to the title.

## Step 0 - Creating a React app

The first step in this React Router tutorial is creating a new React app. In case you already have a project, you can skip this step.


```bash
npx create-react-app router-tutorial
```

Go the directory you just creating and run the application. Check that a React app is now running on http://localhost:3000.

```bash
cd router-tutorial # go to the root of the project
npm start # starts the app
```

## Step 1 - Installing the React Router package
Now that we have a React app, we will install the React Router package. You can find more info about this package on https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom. 
Install the package with the following command:
```bash
npm i react-router-dom
```
Make sure you execute this command in the root of your React app (for me, that's "router-tutorial" directory).
